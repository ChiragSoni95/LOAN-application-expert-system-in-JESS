# LOAN-application-expert-system-in-JESS
Loan Application Expert system is a rule based expert system designed using JESS wherein information of a loan applicant is asserted by the user of the Bank, and finally concludes whether applicant is eligible to apply for a loan or not. System also provides suggestions to the user of the system to help him/her to make a decision in a very convenient manner. The expert system checks for all the parameters asserted by the user and finally claims the decision depending upon its interpretation and a few important rules set in the bank’s policy.

For running this project, get Jess from  http://www.jessrules.com/jess/download.shtml

1) Copy the Megamind.clp into the bin folder inside the JESS directory.
